# Understanding the GitHub flow

## Branching
GitHub supports branching of projects. Basically, this means creating a copy of the original project you're free to change in any way without compromising the original.

> Branching is a core concept in Git, and the entire GitHub flow is based upon it. There's only one rule: anything in the master branch is always deployable.
> Because of this, it's extremely important that your new branch is created off of master when working on a feature or a fix. Your branch name should be descriptive (e.g., refactor-authentication, user-content-cache-key, make-retina-avatars), so that others can see what is being worked on.
