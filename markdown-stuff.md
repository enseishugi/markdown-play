# Important remarks
1. [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
1. Remember to name files with .md (Markdown) extension.
1. It's similar to org (it's a markup language, after all...).

# Header
## Sub(1)-header
### Sub(2)-header
#### Sub(3)-header
##### Sub(4)-header
###### Sub(5)-header
####### Sub(6)-header
 
# Emphasis
1. For emphasis, both *this* and _this_ work.
1. For bold, both **this** and __this__ work.
1. Both can be combined like __*this*__.

# Lists

# Hypertext
Both URLs and images can be inserted like [this](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Yoneda+lemma) and ![this](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/YonedaObituary.jpg).

# Blockquotes
We can even insert blockquotes by starting lines with >:
> __Yoneda Lemma__
> Let C be a locally small category, and let Psh(C) be the category of presheaves on C.
> Let y : C -> Psh(C) be the Yoneda embedding.
> For any presheaf X in PSh(C) there is a natural isomorphism between Hom(y(), X) and X.

# Inline code
Markdown supports inline code like `this`.
